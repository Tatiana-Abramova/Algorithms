# Algorithms
A project with different solutions of tasks related to algorithms.

Each task is presented as a set of files with:
- a description of a task ("problem.txt"), 
- a set of test cases ("test.N.in", where N is a number of a test case),
- a corresponding set of answers ("test.N.out", where N is a number of a test case). 

A solution for a task is presented in a separate class. 

The 'test environment' performs a solution verification and shows whether test cases are passed or not.
Also it prints a comparative table of different algorithms running time.
